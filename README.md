# Hate Speech Recognizer

This repository contains the code and resources for the Hate Speech Recognizer project. The project aims to build a machine learning model to classify comments as hate speech or not.

## Dataset

The project uses the 'Ethos_Dataset_Multi_Label.csv' dataset, which contains comment data and corresponding labels for hate speech classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib

   You can install the dependencies using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the provided code in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the dataset file 'Ethos_Dataset_Multi_Label.csv' in the project directory.
2. Run the code in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the Hate Speech Recognizer model.
3. Customize the code as needed to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or evaluation metrics.
